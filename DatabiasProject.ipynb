        "    - Example hypotheses could be that Perspective will make more mistakes on shorter or more informal pieces of content (like tweets), or that Perspective will be less likely to mark anti-male content as toxic when compared to anti-female content, or that Perspective will fail if we replace the most common swear words with less common obscenities.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - You will then develop your own (small) test set of N example comments, document the model scores, and labels extracted from the model using the threshold of 0.5. Based on this, you will assess whether or not your hypothesis was correct based on your sample, following what we did in hands-on 11 on 11/02/2023. These examples may be freshly written by you or downloaded from the internet or even copied from any public data sources.\n",

With that said, something interesting to note is that the word 'retarded' which is now commonly regarded as a slur was not tagged as toxic, and rather the 'clean' version was flagged as much more toxic than the original text (0.37 vs 0.60). This may be due to the word not being considered as a 'slur' during the time of the database being made, and as such these sentences pass by the toxicity detection.\n",
